## Description
***
FunctionFlow is an integration platform that empowers users to freely combine various jobs as a workflow, while offering the flexibility to select the execution time through scheduled trigger service, automate and customize with ease.   
FunctionFlow mainly consists of two parts. One is the frontend interface and backend server for users to create, edit, and manually trigger workflows. The other major part is that each workflow [job is executed using AWS Lambda](https://github.com/tzutingspace/functionflow_lambda).

This projects contains two repositories:

1. [Backend server and frontend web pages (this repo) ](https://github.com/tzutingspace/functionflow)
2. [All Lambda code and the SQS and Lambda deployments done through CDK](https://github.com/tzutingspace/functionflow_lambda)
